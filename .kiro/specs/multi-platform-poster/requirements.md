# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A cross-platform desktop application for Ubuntu/Linux built with Flutter and Dart that enables users to simultaneously post messages to multiple social media platforms (Mastodon, Bluesky, and Nostr). The application features a simple, clean interface with light/dark mode support, multi-account management, selective platform posting, and system tray integration for convenient access.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a social media user, I want to compose and post messages to multiple platforms simultaneously, so that I can efficiently share content across my social networks without repetitive posting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the application THEN the system SHALL display a main window with a text input area for composing messages
2. WHEN the user types in the text input area THEN the system SHALL allow up to the maximum character limit supported by the selected platforms
3. WHEN the user clicks the post button THEN the system SHALL publish the message to all selected platforms simultaneously
4. IF posting fails on any platform THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages for each failed platform while still posting to successful platforms

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user with accounts on multiple platforms, I want to selectively choose which platforms to post to for each message, so that I can customize my content distribution based on the message context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the main window is displayed THEN the system SHALL show checkboxes for Mastodon, Bluesky, and Nostr below the text input area
2. WHEN the user clicks a platform checkbox THEN the system SHALL toggle the selection state for that platform
3. WHEN no platforms are selected THEN the system SHALL disable the post button and display a warning message
4. WHEN at least one platform is selected THEN the system SHALL enable the post button

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user with multiple accounts per platform, I want to manage and select different accounts for each service, so that I can post from the appropriate account based on my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses account settings THEN the system SHALL display options to add, edit, and remove accounts for each platform
2. WHEN multiple accounts exist for a platform THEN the system SHALL provide a dropdown or selection mechanism to choose the active account
3. WHEN the user adds a new account THEN the system SHALL securely store authentication credentials and validate the connection
4. IF an account authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and prevent posting from that account

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user who prefers different visual themes, I want to switch between light and dark modes, so that I can use the application comfortably in different lighting conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL apply the user's previously selected theme or default to system theme
2. WHEN the user toggles the theme setting THEN the system SHALL immediately switch between light and dark modes
3. WHEN the theme is changed THEN the system SHALL persist the preference for future application launches
4. WHEN system theme changes THEN the system SHALL automatically update if set to follow system theme

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user who wants quick access to posting, I want the application to run in the system tray, so that I can quickly open the posting window without having to launch the full application each time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL display an icon in the system tray
2. WHEN the user clicks the system tray icon THEN the system SHALL show/hide the main application window
3. WHEN the user closes the main window THEN the system SHALL minimize to tray instead of fully exiting
4. WHEN the user right-clicks the tray icon THEN the system SHALL display a context menu with options to open, settings, and quit
5. WHEN the user selects quit from tray menu THEN the system SHALL completely exit the application

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure my account settings and application preferences through a dedicated settings interface, so that I can customize the application behavior to my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the settings button THEN the system SHALL open a settings window or panel
2. WHEN in settings THEN the system SHALL provide sections for account management, theme preferences, and application behavior
3. WHEN the user modifies settings THEN the system SHALL validate inputs and provide immediate feedback
4. WHEN settings are saved THEN the system SHALL apply changes immediately and persist them for future sessions
5. IF settings contain invalid data THEN the system SHALL prevent saving and display specific error messages

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user concerned about security, I want my account credentials to be stored securely, so that my social media accounts remain protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enters account credentials THEN the system SHALL encrypt and store them using secure storage mechanisms
2. WHEN the application accesses stored credentials THEN the system SHALL decrypt them only when needed for API calls
3. WHEN the user removes an account THEN the system SHALL completely delete all associated credential data
4. IF credential storage fails THEN the system SHALL notify the user and prevent account setup completion

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback about posting status and any errors, so that I know whether my messages were successfully published.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN posting begins THEN the system SHALL display a progress indicator and disable the post button
2. WHEN posting completes successfully THEN the system SHALL display a success message and clear the text input
3. WHEN posting fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages for each platform that failed
4. WHEN posting is in progress THEN the system SHALL allow the user to cancel the operation
5. IF network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL detect this and provide appropriate error messaging
