# Package Structure Fix - v1.0.2

## Issue Resolved
The initial v1.0.2 packages had a file conflict issue where Flutter assets were installed directly in `/usr/bin/data/flutter_assets/`, which could conflict with other Flutter applications like `what-next`.

## Solution
**Updated packages** (available now) install application files in the proper location:
- **Application files**: `/usr/lib/yall/` (application-specific directory)
- **Executable wrapper**: `/usr/bin/yall` (simple wrapper script)
- **Desktop integration**: `/usr/share/applications/yall.desktop`

## Fixed Package Checksums

```

## Installation
The fixed packages can now be installed without conflicts:

### Debian/Ubuntu
```bash
sudo dpkg -i yall-1.0.2.deb
```

### RHEL/Fedora/SUSE
```bash
sudo rpm -i yall-1.0.2-1.x86_64.rpm
```

## How it Works
- The main application and all Flutter assets are installed in `/usr/lib/yall/`
- A simple wrapper script in `/usr/bin/yall` launches the application
- This eliminates file conflicts with other Flutter applications
- Application works exactly the same for users

## If You Had the Conflicting Package
If you previously had the file conflict, you can now safely install the updated package:

1. **Remove conflicting package** (if you don't need it):
   ```bash
   sudo dpkg --remove what-next
   sudo dpkg -i yall-1.0.2.deb
   ```

2. **Or just install the fixed package** (should work now):
   ```bash
   sudo dpkg -i yall-1.0.2.deb
   ```

The updated packages follow Linux packaging best practices and should not conflict with any other applications.
